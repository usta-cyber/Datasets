# Datasets
The Titanic dataset is a famous dataset that contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic ship, which sank in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg. The dataset is often used in data science and machine learning education and competitions as a starting point for exploring data analysis and predictive modeling techniques.

The Titanic dataset contains information about **1309** passengers, including their age, gender, ticket class, cabin, port of embarkation, and whether they survived or not. The goal of many analyses and models built on the Titanic dataset is to predict whether a given passenger would have survived the disaster.

The variables in the Titanic dataset are as follows:
**PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger name
Sex: Passenger gender
Age: Passenger age
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)**
As mentioned earlier, the main objective of many analyses and models built on the Titanic dataset is to predict whether a given passenger would have survived the disaster, based on their demographic and travel information. This is a **binary classification problem**, where the target variable is **Survived** and the predictors are the other variables in the dataset.
